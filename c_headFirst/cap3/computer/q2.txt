parts the file will be price,cpu,gpu,psu,motherboard,n_ofcoolers,powerusage.

R$2300,ryen7,gtx1080,collermaster850w,b450m,3,500w



fulture:
R$1300,ryen7,type=cpu.
this will be read and stored in a array with the cpu name and price 
so we have cpu array gpu array psu array cooler array.with all of these than
the user will be asked to select the parts
